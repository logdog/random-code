# Qwister
iOS Application for Twister Spinner
## What does it do?
Have ever been at a party and wanted to play a quick game of Twister, but you couldn't find a spinner? Or if you did find a spinner
it was old and warped and kept getting stuck on left foot red? 
Well now there's no need to fear, with __Qwister__! Simply download the app from the app store, and it's all yours!
## Features
Along with always being reliable and at your fingertips, __Qwister__ has some innovative features that even a perfect Twister Spinner doesn't have. These include:
### Smart Spinners
Spinners won't stop on right-hand-yellow if your hand is already on right-hand-yellow! This allows for faster game play and less confusion amongst players.
### Text-to-speech techonology 
iOS 7 features allow for the app to call out commands hands-free, meaning you can finally play Twister by yourself!
You can even pair your iOS device to a bluetooth speaker for easy-to-hear commands.
### Simple user-interface 
Tells you where each limb should be on the board at any given time. Just look at the top of the screen at any moment to clearly see where each limb should be.
### Three different gameplay modes 
1. Manual  
  * Allows users to manually spin the spinner by simply tapping the screen, for a more traditional approach.
2. Automatic  
  * Allows users to have the computer call out a command every x seconds. Great for small parties where everyone wants to play.
3. Semi-Automatic  
  * The perfect marriage of the first two modes. Users can tap the screen to spin the spinner, but when the given elapsed time has passed, the computer will automatically spin for you!  
  
### Remembers favorite settings
Allows you to customize default settings like gameplay mode and seconds between turns.
### Doesn't Use WiFi
Yes, that's right! Finally, an app that doesn't require an internet connection. You can play Twister *anywhere*.
### Features Morgan Freeman's head as the spinner
Like seriously, how could you not love seeing Morgan Freeman's head spin as he sooths you with his calming voice?!
